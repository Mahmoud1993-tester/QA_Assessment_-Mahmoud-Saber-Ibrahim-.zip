### Steps to Reproduce
1. Log into Mailchimp and navigate to the Campaigns dashboard.
2. Create a new Email Campaign (Regular type).
3. Complete all required steps: audience, subject line, content, sender info.
4. Schedule the campaign to send at `10:00 AM`.
5. In the campaign flow, choose to "Send a follow-up email" to non-openers.
6. Set the follow-up to be sent at `10:30 AM` (i.e., 30 minutes after initial send).
7. Finish and schedule the campaign.
8. Wait past the scheduled follow-up time and monitor "Sent" stats.

### Expected Result
The follow-up email should be sent at the scheduled time (10:30 AM) to recipients who did not open the original email.

---

### Actual Result
No follow-up email is sent. The dashboard still shows it as "Scheduled" even after the time has passed. No delivery or error is logged.
